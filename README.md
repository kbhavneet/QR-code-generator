# QR-code-generator
QR code generator is a simple Node.js application that allows users to generate QR codes from URLs. It utilizes the 'inquirer' package for command-line interaction and 'qr-image' for QR code generation. Users can input their desired URL, and the program will generate a QR code image ('qr_img.png') and save the URL to a text file ('URL.txt').
